## Camping Data

Here I bound rows of certain regions of the CSV file from
[campgrounds.info](http://www.uscampgrounds.info/takeit.html), interpreted some of
the fields, then found the closest GHCN station in the NOAA weather station
network. The idea is to have a dataset which is searchable by amenities, distance
from home, and eventually climate.
